## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone! There are several ways to contribute to this project:

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter a bug or unexpected behavior, please help us by reporting it. Here's how you can do that:

2. If it has **not been reported**, open a new issue with the following information:
   - A clear and concise description of the problem.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Your environment (OS, Go version, Bambulabs printer model, etc.).
   - Any relevant logs or error messages.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We are always open to new ideas! If you have a suggestion for improving the library, feel free to open an issue or discuss it with the community. Please include:

- A detailed description of the feature or enhancement.
- Why you think this enhancement will improve the project.
- Any possible alternatives or design suggestions.

### Submitting Code

If you'd like to submit code to improve the project, follow these steps:

1. **Fork** the repository by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the project page.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bambulabs_api.git
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your feature or bug fix:

## Development Workflow

We use a **Git flow-based workflow** for managing contributions:

- **Feature branches**: Each feature or bug fix should be worked on in its own branch.
- **Pull Requests**: When you're ready to submit your changes, open a pull request with a description of your changes.
- **Code Review**: The pull request will undergo a review process. Feedback will be provided, and once it's approved, the changes will be merged into the main branch.

## Coding Guidelines

To maintain consistency across the codebase, we ask that you follow these coding standards:

- **Go Code Style**: Follow [Go’s official code style guide](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).
- **Code Comments**: Provide meaningful comments where necessary. Describe **why** something is done, not **what** is done (that should be obvious from the code itself).
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors in a consistent manner and propagate errors when necessary.
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow Go naming conventions for variables, functions, types, etc.
- **Code Formatting**: Run `go fmt` on your code before committing.

---

## Testing

We strongly encourage writing tests for any new features or bug fixes.

- If you're adding new functionality, please write tests for it.
- Run the existing tests to ensure no existing functionality is broken:
  ```bash
  go test ./...
  ```

We use Go's built-in testing framework for tests. If you have added new functionality or fixed a bug, be sure to cover it with appropriate tests.

---

## Documentation

If you're contributing to the code, don't forget to update the documentation if necessary. This includes:

- Updating or adding comments to the code.
- Updating this README file if you’ve added new features or changed existing functionality.
- Adding or modifying docstrings for any new or modified functions.
